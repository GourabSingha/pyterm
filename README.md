# pyterm
A terminal emulator complete with a shell enriched with commands and its own file system written in pure python

This is an old project of mine from 2014

The aim of this project is to emulate a shell environment written in pure python

As you may have noticed the version number starts from 1.6 as versions prior to that were simply not working when I
decided to upload all the code to GitHub.
